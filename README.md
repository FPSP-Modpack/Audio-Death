Audio Death
===========

Minecraft mod to play a audio file on death.

Instructions
------------

There should be audio already present.

To customise place the audio file (preferrably as ogg) in

    <minecraft dir>/mods-resourcepacks/audiodeath/sounds/
    
and modify 

    <minecraft dir>/mods-resourcepacks/audiodeath/sounds.json

according to the name of the file.

Then start the game. If the game is already running, go into resource packs and then back out again (this reloads textures)
  
To restore default sound files, delete

    <minecraft dir>/mods-resourcepacks/

and restart the game.

Have fun.
